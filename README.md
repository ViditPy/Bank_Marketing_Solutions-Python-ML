 ## ABOUT THE DATASET

 
 The dataset consists of direct marketing campaigns data of a "PORTUGUESE BANKING INSTITUTION. There were four variants of the datasets out of which we chose “ bank1.csv” which consists of 45211 data points with 17 independent variables out of which 10 are numeric features and 10 are categorical features. The list of features available to us are given below:
bank client data:


age (numeric)


job : type of job (['management', 'technician', 'entrepreneur', 'blue-collar',
       'unknown', 'retired', 'admin.', 'services', 'self-employed',
       'unemployed', 'housemaid', 'student']
       

marital : marital status (categorical: ‘divorced’,’married’,’single’,’unknown’; note: ‘divorced’ means divorced or widowed)

education (categorical: ['tertiary', 'secondary', 'unknown', 'primary']

default: has credit in default? (categorical: ‘no’,’yes’,’unknown’)
housing: has housing loan? (categorical: ‘no’,’yes’,’unknown’)

loan: has personal loan? (categorical: ‘no’,’yes’,’unknown’)
Related with the last contact of the current campaign:

 contact: contact communication type (categorical: ‘cellular’,’telephone’,unknown)

 month: last contact month of year (categorical: ‘jan’, ‘feb’, ‘mar’, …, ‘nov’, ‘dec’)

 day: (1st to 31 st of the month )


 duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y=’no’). 
Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
other attributes:

 campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)

 pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)

 previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)

 poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: ['unknown', 'failure', 'other', 'success'])
